# Ratelimiter_app
This is the Ratelimiter designed using Sliding window approach for rate limiting API usage.


In this project we are going to build a simple Ratelimter using Flask python.
Then we test our API with the endpoint /api/resource using Postman and verify the Ratelimiting implmented by our python code.
